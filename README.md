CTO @ Grant Compass - devising and developing services aimed at enabling foundations and applicants to take control of their data and finances, ultimately achieving more impact. #techforgood

In charge of development, delivery & compliance. #privacybydesign

Tech agnostic and curious by nature, but currently enjoying working with ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, Apollo, Sequelize and Postgres.

I strongly believe in co-creation, multidisciplinary teams and pragmatic agility in product development.

Quite enthusiastic about sustainability and nature.
Also a fan of golf, metal music and things with zombies.
