# Stefan K. Hansen

CTO @ Grant Compass - "Mere overskud til det gode form√•l"\
Developing services aimed at enabling foundations and applicants to take control of their data and finances, ultimately achieving more impact. *#techforgood*

In charge of development, delivery & compliance. *#privacybydesign*

Tech agnostic and curious by nature, but currently enjoying working with ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, Apollo, Sequelize and Postgres.

I believe in co-creation, multidisciplinary teams and pragmatic agility in product development.

Quite enthusiastic about sustainability and nature.
Also a fan of metal music, golf and things with zombies.
